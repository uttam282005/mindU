## What Are Worry Butterflies? 🦋

Everyone gets worried sometimes - even grown-ups! When we feel worried or stressed, it might feel like:

* Having butterflies in your tummy
* Your heart beating fast like a drum
* Your thoughts zooming around like race cars
* Feeling like you want to hide under your blanket

  Here are some super-cool tricks you can try when the worry butterflies come to visit:

  1. **The Balloon Breath** 🎈
     - Pretend your tummy is a balloon
     - Breathe in slowly through your nose, making the balloon bigger
     - Blow out slowly through your mouth, letting the balloon shrink
     - Do this 5 times
  
  2. **The Superhero Pose** 🦸‍♀️
     - Stand tall like your favorite superhero
     - Put your hands on your hips
     - Take big, brave breaths
     - Remember: You're stronger than you think!
  
  3. **The Worry Monster Drawing** 🎨
     - Draw your worries as silly monsters
     - Give them funny names
     - Color them in your favorite colors
     - Sometimes making worries look silly helps them feel smaller!
